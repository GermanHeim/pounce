// POUNCE as a CasADi `Nlpsol` plugin.
//
// Registers `casadi_register_nlpsol_pounce`, so once
// `libcasadi_nlpsol_pounce.so` is on CasADi's plugin search path a model
// solves with `nlpsol('S', 'pounce', nlp, opts)` or
// `opti.solver('pounce')`, exactly like the bundled `ipopt` plugin.
//
// The plugin is a thin shim: CasADi's oracle functions are wired into
// POUNCE through `pounce.h`, the Ipopt-3.14-compatible C API that
// `libpounce_cinterface` exports. Everything CasADi layers on top of a
// plugin — solution-map derivatives, `Opti`, bound consistency — comes
// from the `Nlpsol` base class and needs nothing from us.
//
// Build: see the Makefile in this directory. Two constraints are not
// optional and are easy to get wrong:
//   * the internal headers must come from the *matching* CasADi source
//     tree (the pip wheel ships only public headers);
//   * the libstdc++ ABI and the `-D` set must match the CasADi build —
//     for the pip wheels that means `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0`.
