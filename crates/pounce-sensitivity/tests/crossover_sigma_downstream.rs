//! What crossover's barrier diagonal `Σ = z/s` does to a *downstream*
//! reduced Hessian (gh#653).
//!
//! gh#612's PR left open "what does `Σ = V/S` do at exact-zero slack",
//! on the assumption that crossover — which puts the iterate *on* a
//! bound — drives `Σ` toward infinity and degrades whatever the
//! sensitivity path factorizes. Measurement inverted that. `Σ` is
//! finite, and a larger `Σ` is a *more* accurate answer, because `Σ` is
//! the stiffness with which the barrier pins the bounded variable and
//! the reduced Hessian's residual error is the `O(1/Σ)` leftover of
//! that pin being finite.
//!
//! # Fixture
//!
//! `min ½xᵀQx − qᵀx` over `x = (a, b, w)`, with `a` and `b` held by
//! equality rows (the pins the reduced Hessian is taken over) and `w`
//! capped by an upper bound that binds with multiplier `z ≈ 4.5` —
//! strictly complementary, so the barrier has no excuse. `Q` is
//! non-diagonal, which is what makes the measurement discriminating:
//!
//! ```text
//! w pinned at its bound : H_R = Q_ab                = [[4, 1], [1, 3]]
//! w free (eliminated)   : H_R = Q_ab − q_w q_wᵀ/Q_ww = [[3.2, .6], [.6, 2.8]]
//! ```
//!
//! Those differ by `O(1)`, so drift toward the second is unmissable.
//! The solver returns the first plus an error of exactly `Q_aw²/Σ_w`
//! — the bound block's Schur complement.
//!
//! When this file was written that law matched to every printed digit
//! at both ends of a 300× range in `Σ`. Since gh#654 the crossed-over
//! run reads `Σ` against the declared bounds instead of the relaxed
//! ones, and on this fixture that puts `w` within an ulp of its cap:
//! `Σ` saturates near `z/eps ≈ 2e16` and the predicted residual drops
//! below the roundoff of `H_R` itself. The law is still what is
//! asserted wherever it can be seen; where it cannot, the assertion is
//! that the error sits at roundoff. See
//! [`the_reduced_hessian_error_tracks_one_over_sigma`].
//!
//! `compute_reduced_hessian` returns `−H_R` under its sign convention
//! (`−inv(H_R)` is the covariance), so every assertion here negates it.

// assertion it made is now false in the direction that means the bug is
// gone: crossover under `bound_relax_factor = 1e-8` is no longer
// distinguishable from crossover at declared bounds.
//
// Deleting it leaves no gap. The replacement lives in
// `crossover_sigma_frame.rs`, which pins the same comparison from the
// other side — that the two runs now *agree* — across a range of bound
// multipliers rather than at the single `z ≈ 4.5` this fixture reaches.
