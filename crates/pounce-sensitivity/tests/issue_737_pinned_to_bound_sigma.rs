//! A declared parameter pinned to exactly a bound of the variable it
//! pins (gh#737).
//!
//! # The defect
//!
//! A model can pin a variable to a parameter, `x == p`, and then give
//! the parameter a value that sits exactly on one of `x`'s own bounds.
//! `d x/d p` is then `1` by construction: the equality is linear and
//! says so. What came back instead was `0`, for the whole column
//! through `x` — the parameter's own Var absorbed **half** the
//! requested delta and the other half came back as the residual of a
//! linear equality that the step is supposed to satisfy exactly. An
//! even split is what a solve returns when two rows have stopped being
//! distinguishable to it, and here they had: with `x` gone from the
//! system, `x − p = 0` and `p = p₀ + Δ` are two inconsistent equations
//! in the one remaining unknown.
//!
//! # Why `x` was gone
//!
//! `x` is held between a bound and an equality that both bind, so the
//! force that holds it has no unique split between the two and the
//! solve lands with a bound multiplier far larger than the geometry
//! needs, over a slack near roundoff. `Σ = z/s` is the product of both,
//! and on the fixture below it comes out at `6.9e27` against Jacobian
//! entries of `1`.
//!
//! Eliminating `x` through that diagonal leaves each of its constraint
//! rows holding `a²/Σ ≈ 1e-27` — the whole of what the row still knows
//! about `x`, and far under the roundoff of the row it lands in. The
//! factorization has a row it cannot pivot on, and the answer is
//! whatever the singularity handling substitutes.
//!
//! The fix caps `Σ` at the stiffness the constraint rows can still be
//! seen against (`sigma_pin_caps` in `algorithm_backsolver`). It is not
//! a release: the capped pin still holds `x` to within roundoff of its
//! own scale, so a bound that genuinely holds a variable keeps holding
//! it. What changes is only that the equality is once again
//! representable.
//!
//! # Measured on this fixture, before → after
//!
//! ```text
//!                      Σ          d x/d p    d p_var/d p   requested
//!   interior     6.88e27 → 7.0e13   0 → 1     ½ → 1          1
//!   crossover    1.13e25 → 7.0e13   0 → 1     ½ → 1          1
//! ```
//!
//! # The reported model
//!
//! This fixture is a regression test, not the diagnosis. The diagnosis
//! is notebook 36's CSTR, where `zc_init: zc[0] == zc0` with `zc`
//! bounded `(0, 1)` reads `Σ = 1.9e27` and `d zc[0]/d zc0 = 0` at
//! `zc0 = 1.0`, while sIPOPT solves the same model and perturbation
//! correctly. Every `zc0` short of a bound was already right, which is
//! the same shape the `t` sweep has here. Measured on that model, on
//! the commit adding this file against its parent, `d zc[0]/d zc0` goes
//! `0.00000 → 1.00000` at both `zc0 = 0.00` and `zc0 = 1.00` and is
//! unchanged elsewhere, and `estimate()` to `(0.79, 0.57)` returns
//! `zc[0] = 0.790000` in all three modes rather than the baseline.
