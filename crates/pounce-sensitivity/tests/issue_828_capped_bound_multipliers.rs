//! gh#828 — the parametric step's bound-multiplier block, and the
//! corrector's own, read back in the frame the gh#737 ceiling actually
//! built the operator in.
//!
//! `PdFullSpaceSolver` eliminates each bound row into the `x` / `s`
//! barrier diagonal and recovers it afterwards as
//! `dz = r_z/s − (z/s)·dx`, re-deriving `z/s` straight off the iterate.
//! That is right exactly when the diagonal it eliminated into *was*
//! `Σ = Σ z/s`. Under gh#737's ceiling it is not: the solve holds the
//! capped bound softly and reads its multiplier back stiffly, and the
//! two disagree by the cap ratio.
//!
//! # The fixture
//!
//! ```text
//! min exp(x0) − p·x0 + ½(x1 − (2.5 − 2p))² + ½(x2 + 5)²
//! s.t.  p = p0,   A·x2 + x3 = 0,   x1 ≥ 0,  x2 ≥ 0
//! ```
//!
//! with the closed form `x0 = ln p`, `x1 = max(0, 2.5 − 2p)`,
//! `x2 = x3 = 0`, so the truth is independent of the machinery under
//! test. `x2` sits hard on its bound at `Σ = z/s ≈ 2.5e12`; `A` is its
//! only Jacobian coefficient, so it sets that variable's ceiling
//! through `sigma_pin_cap(a) = (a/eps)·(a/64)` and sweeping `A` walks
//! the cap in and out. `x1` is a near-bound row whose slack shrinks
//! 5× over the step and `x0` carries the curvature, so the correction
//! has real work to do in the uncapped coordinates.
//!
//! # Mutation table
//!
//! Measured at `delta = 0.2`, `tol = 1e-10`, `bound_relax_factor = 0`,
//! budget 8. `dz` is the returned step's entry for `x2`'s lower-bound
//! multiplier, whose true value is `0` — `z2 = 5` at both parameter
//! values, the `½(x2+5)²` term not depending on `p`.
//!
//! | `A` | `dz` before | `dz` after | corrected error before | after |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1e-4 | 1.776e7  | −7.10e-6  | 1.7678e-2 (no progress) | 1.553e-4 |
//! | 1e-3 | 1.776e5  | −7.10e-8  | 1.7678e-2 (no progress) | 4.736e-8 |
//! | 1e-2 | 1.771e3  | −7.10e-10 | 1.7678e-2 (no progress) | 4.817e-10 |
//! | 1e-1 | 1.276e1  | −7.11e-12 | 1.0000e-10              | 1.000e-10 |
//! | 1.0  | −2.0e-12 | −2.0e-12  | 1.0000e-10              | 1.000e-10 |
//!
//! The ceiling does not bind at `A = 1.0` (`Σ = 2.5e12` against a cap
//! of `7.0e13`), which is the arm that pins the fix as a no-op off the
//! capped path — every number in that row is bit-identical across the
//! change. Reintroduce the defect by dropping either call to
//! `rescale_bound_multipliers` and the four capped rows go back to the
//! "before" column, and each mutation is caught by the test whose name
//! describes it: dropping the predictor's restores the `A⁻²` blow-up
//! in `dz` and the corrector then opens on it, while dropping only the
//! corrector's leaves it opening on the right `2.14e-2` and still
//! unable to reduce it — `improved() == false` at `A ≤ 1e-2`, from a
//! chord that softens the bound and reads it back stiff.
//!
//! Two more mutations, each caught by exactly one leg and by no
//! other: turning over the sign in the `px_u` arm — silent above,
//! because every rung in the table is bounded *below* only, so the
//! `z_u` block never executes — reddens
//! [`the_upper_bound_branch_is_read_back_through_its_cap_too`]; and
//! moving the rescale to *after* the natural-units conjugation, which
//! is invisible at unit scaling, reddens
//! [`the_capped_correction_survives_a_change_of_variables`].
//!
//! # Which branch this reaches
//!
//! Every case here corrects with `released == 0` and `pinned == 0` —
//! asserted below, so a later reader does not mistake it for
//! evidence about the active-set branches. Those diagonals are not a
//! rescaling of the base one and deliberately carry no ratio;
//! `corrector_ceiling.rs` is the file that drives the pinned branch
//! under the same ceiling.
//!
//! Nor is it evidence about the `s` block. Every fixture here has
//! `dims[1] == 0` — no inequality slacks — so `ratio_s` is empty and
//! the `pd_l` / `pd_u` arms of the rescale are never entered. They
//! carry the same two signs as the `x` arms one block over, and a
//! model with a bounded `d(x)` row stiff enough to reach
//! `sigma_pin_cap(1.0) = 7.0e13` is what would exercise them.
