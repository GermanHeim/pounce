[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pounce-rs.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/pounce-rs) [![CI](https://github.com/jkitchin/pounce/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jkitchin/pounce/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/pounce-rs)](https://docs.rs/pounce-rs)

A single-crate entry point for solving optimization problems with
[POUNCE](https://github.com/jkitchin/pounce) in Rust. For nonlinear programs —
the default build — it provides two APIs:

- a high-level builder API (`Problem` + `Nlp`) for the common case, where only the objective is required and everything else is optional; and
- the low-level `TNLP` trait, re-exported for full control over Hessians, sparsity patterns, scaling, and other advanced features.

Both APIs are backed by the same pure-Rust interior-point solver. POUNCE's
other solver paths — convex/LP/QP, active-set QP, and sensitivity analysis —
are behind [feature flags](#feature-flags-beyond-the-nlp-path).

## Install

```sh
cargo add pounce-rs
```

or add it to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
pounce-rs = "0.8"
```

## Quick start

Implement `Problem` (only `objective` is required), then configure and solve
with the `Nlp` builder:

```rust
use pounce_rs::prelude::*;

// min (x0-1)^2 + (x1-2)^2  s.t.  x0 + x1 == 3,  0 <= xi <= 5
struct P;
impl Problem for P {
    fn objective(&self, x: &[f64]) -> f64 {
        (x[0] - 1.0).powi(2) + (x[1] - 2.0).powi(2)
    }
    fn n_constraints(&self) -> usize { 1 }
    fn constraints(&self, x: &[f64], g: &mut [f64]) { g[0] = x[0] + x[1]; }
}

let sol = Nlp::new(P)                     // variable count inferred below
    .var_bounds(&[0.0, 0.0], &[5.0, 5.0])
    .constraint_bounds(&[3.0], &[3.0])    // equality: lower == upper
    .x0(&[0.0, 0.0])
    .option_num("tol", 1e-10)
    .solve();

assert!(sol.success);
assert!((sol.x[0] - 1.0).abs() < 1e-5 && (sol.x[1] - 2.0).abs() < 1e-5);
```

For nonlinear bound tightening, expose each constraint as an `FbbtTape` and
enable the existing presolve options:

`presolve_fbbt=yes` is inactive unless `presolve=yes` is also set.

```rust
impl Problem for P {
    fn constraint_expression(&self, _i: usize) -> Option<FbbtTape> {
        Some(FbbtTape { ops: vec![
            FbbtOp::Var(0), FbbtOp::Var(1), FbbtOp::Add(0, 1),
        ] })
    }
}

let sol = Nlp::new(P)
    .var_bounds(&[0.0, 0.0], &[10.0, 10.0])
    .constraint_bounds(&[3.0], &[3.0])
    .option_str("presolve", "yes")
    .option_str("presolve_fbbt", "yes")
    .solve();
assert!(sol.fbbt_report.is_some());
```

`constraint_expression(i)` must exactly restate the value written by
`constraints()` for row `i`; otherwise FBBT can cut off the true optimum.
`try_solve` compares the two at the starting point and box midpoint and reports
sampled mismatches as `NlpError::InvalidFbbtTape`. This is a smoke check, not a
proof of equivalence, so generate both forms from one source when possible.

Anything you don't implement is provided automatically. Missing gradients and
Jacobians are approximated with finite differences, while the Hessian defaults
to a limited-memory (L-BFGS) approximation. This keeps simple problems concise
without sacrificing access to exact derivatives when needed.

Solver options use the same names as upstream Ipopt
(`option_num`, `option_int`, `option_str`). Names, value types, ranges, and
choices are validated against the option registry. A rejected option is
never applied silently: `solve` panics, and `try_solve` returns
`Err(NlpError::InvalidOption { .. })` naming the option and the reason.

```rust
let sol = Nlp::new(P)
    .x0(&[0.0, 0.0])
    .option_str("mu_strategy", "adaptive")
    .try_solve()?;                        // Result<Solution, NlpError>
```

## Result

`Nlp::solve` returns a `Solution` containing

- `success` and the full `status`
- the optimal point `x`
- the objective value
- constraint multipliers (`multipliers`)
- constraint values (`g`)
- bound multipliers (`z_l` and `z_u`)
- solve statistics (`stats`): wall time, iteration count, evaluation counts,
  and final infeasibilities
- optional FBBT diagnostics (`fbbt_report`)

The vector fields remain empty if the solve aborts before finalization. Opt in
to the full per-iteration trajectory (`stats.iterations`) with
`.capture_iterations()` on the builder.

## Full control: the `TNLP` trait

For problems that need an exact Hessian, custom Jacobian/Hessian sparsity, or
NLP scaling, implement the re-exported `TNLP` trait directly and drive it with
`IpoptApplication`. The whole surface is reachable through the prelude.

See the [crate docs on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/pounce-rs) for a complete HS071
`TNLP` walkthrough.

## Feature flags: beyond the NLP path

The default build is the NLP path only. POUNCE's other solver families live in
their own modules behind features — separate modules because the two QP
families both name their types `QpProblem` / `QpSolution` / `QpStatus`, so a
flat surface could not carry both:

| feature | module | what it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `convex` | `pounce_rs::convex` | LP, convex QP, SOCP / exponential / power / PSD cones, SOS; batched and warm-started solves; symbolic-factorization reuse; QP sensitivity and reduced Hessian |
| `qp` | `pounce_rs::qp`, `pounce_rs::sqp` | sparse **parametric active-set** QP — the SQP / MPC / continuation engine, indefinite Hessians allowed — plus the SQP working-set warm-start contract |
| `sensitivity` | `pounce_rs::sensitivity` | sIPOPT-style NLP sensitivity: `∂x*/∂p` predictors, parametric warm starts, reduced Hessian |
| `full` | — | all three |

```toml
[dependencies]
pounce-rs = { version = "0.9", features = ["convex", "sensitivity"] }
```

`convex` and `qp` also bring in `pounce_rs::linsol`, whose `backend()` supplies
the sparse symmetric factorization those entry points take as an argument.

```rust
use pounce_rs::convex::{QpOptions, QpProblem, QpStatus, Triplet, solve_qp_batch_parallel};
use pounce_rs::linsol::serial_backend;

// A batch of box-constrained QPs, one per rayon worker.
let sols = solve_qp_batch_parallel(&probs, &QpOptions::default(), serial_backend);
assert!(sols.iter().all(|s| s.status == QpStatus::Optimal));
```

Enabling a feature widens what this crate *exports*; it is close to free at
build time, because the default NLP path already pulls `pounce-qp`,
`pounce-linsol`, and `pounce-feral` transitively. Only `convex` and
`sensitivity` add crates to compile.
