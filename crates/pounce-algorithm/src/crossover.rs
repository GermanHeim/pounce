//! NLP crossover: hand a converged interior-point iterate to the
//! active-set path so the solve ends on an **exact** active set
//! (Byrd, Nocedal & Waltz, "KNITRO: An Integrated Package for
//! Nonlinear Optimization", 2006, §7; gh#612).
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! An interior-point method never puts an iterate *on* a constraint: the
//! fraction-to-boundary rule keeps every slack strictly positive, so at
//! termination "which constraints are active" is an inference from a
//! tolerance test, not a fact the solve established. Where **strict
//! complementarity holds** that inference is right and this whole phase is a
//! no-op by design. Where it fails — a weakly active bound whose slack and
//! multiplier are both `O(√μ)` — the interior solve cannot answer the
//! question at all, and three subsystems downstream are already paying for
//! that:
//!
//! 1. [`pounce_sensitivity`]'s `covariance()` classifies activity into
//!    STRONGLY ACTIVE / WEAKLY ACTIVE / **AMBIGUOUS** / UNIDENTIFIED
//!    (`docs/src/sensitivity.md`). The AMBIGUOUS class exists precisely
//!    because a barrier geometry cannot decide.
//! 2. A degenerate solution collapses the reduced Hessian, which has come
//!    back as an inertia problem repeatedly (#540, #541, #544, #592, the
//!    `feral_singular_pivot_floor` knob) and been met each time on the
//!    perturbation side.
//! 3. The active-set SQP's warm start could only come from a previous *SQP*
//!    solve (`docs/src/active-set-sqp.md`), so a sequence whose first solve
//!    wants the IPM had no way to hand off. Crossover is that missing edge:
//!    after it runs, [`crate::application::IpoptApplication::last_sqp_working_set`]
//!    returns a working set the next `algorithm=active-set-sqp` solve can
//!    consume.
//!
//! `pounce-convex` has had the LP form of this for a while
//! ([`pounce_convex::crossover`]); this is the NLP analogue, and it borrows
//! that module's two load-bearing ideas: crossover is a **bridge**, not a new
//! solver, and it is **never-regress** — the crossed-over point replaces the
//! interior one only when it is at least as good a KKT point.
//!
//! # What it does (paper §7)
//!
//! 1. The IPM terminates at `(x, y, z)` within `E_tol`.
//! 2. Estimate the active set `A` by a tolerance test on primal distance and
//!    multiplier magnitude — [`crate::sqp::classify_working_set`], the same
//!    classifier the sensitivity-corrector handoff already uses.
//! 3. Take **one EQP step over `A`** plus a line search on the penalty model.
//!    If the result satisfies the stopping tolerances, terminate. This is the
//!    common path and it solves no LPs, so on a well-behaved problem
//!    crossover costs about one iteration.
//! 4. Otherwise run the full active-set algorithm from the interior iterate,
//!    seeded with `A` and with `ν₀` a little above the largest `|multiplier|`
//!    at the interior solution.
//!
//! # Where this departs from the paper
//!
//! KNITRO's active-set path is **SLQP**: an LP phase picks the working set
//! and an EQP phase computes the step, so its step 3 is a literal EQP solve
//! and its step 4 sizes an LP trust region (their eq. 7.22) to exclude every
//! inactive constraint. POUNCE's active-set path is an ordinary line-search
//! **SQP** over `pounce-qp`'s working-set interface, so:
//!
//! - Step 3 is expressed as one `pounce-qp`
//!   [`QpSolver::solve_with_working_set`] against the NLP linearization at
//!   the interior iterate, warm-started with `A`. That call factorizes the
//!   hinted active set to recover a primal, then pivots — which is exactly
//!   "solve the EQP over `A`, and fix `A` where the tolerance test got it
//!   wrong". The paper's guarantee that step 3 avoids an LP is preserved:
//!   `pounce-qp` solves no LP either.
//! - Step 4's LP trust region has no analogue and is **not** implemented; the
//!   `ν₀` half of that setup is, since the ℓ₁ merit the SQP already carries
//!   takes exactly that parameter.
//!
//! # It runs against the *declared* bounds
//!
//! The caller hands this an
//! [`crate::sqp::IpoptNlpAdapter::new_with_declared_bounds`], not a plain
//! one, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. `bound_relax_factor`
//! (default `1e-8`) widens every bound before the interior solve starts, so
//! a point sitting exactly on a bound the user declared is a full `1e-8`
//! *inside* the relaxed one. Measured against the relaxed bounds, a pivot
//! that lands precisely on the binding constraint reads as strictly
//! interior, and the identification step then correctly reports an empty
//! active set — crossover would run, succeed, and answer nothing. Worse, the
//! pivot itself would stop `1e-8` shy of each constraint, because against
//! the relaxed problem that point genuinely is optimal.
//!
//! So the whole phase is posed on the model as written. The consequence to
//! be aware of is that the returned point can sit on a declared bound rather
//! than inside it, which is `constr_viol_tol`-legal by construction (the
//! relaxation is capped there) and is the result being asked for.
//!
//! # Never-regress
//!
//! Crossover is a strict refinement of a solve that has already succeeded, so
//! the bar is not "did it solve" but "is this at least as good a KKT point".
//! [`accepts`] applies three gates against the interior iterate — constraint
//! violation, stationarity, and objective — and any failure returns the
//! interior solution untouched. Nothing here can turn a converged solve into
//! a failed one: on every abandonment path the caller keeps what the IPM
//! produced.
//!
//! # Cost and defaults
//!
//! Off by default (`crossover=no`). It runs strictly *after* convergence, so
//! enabling it moves no interior trajectory and needs no baseline fixture
//! sweep (contrast an initial-point or merit-function change, per
//! `CLAUDE.md`).
