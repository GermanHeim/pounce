//! Square-system recovery: when the interior-point solve of a square,
//! constant-objective model fails, solve `c(x) = 0` directly.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! A model with as many free variables as equality rows, no inequality rows
//! and a constant objective is not an optimization problem. It is a system of
//! nonlinear equations wearing an NLP's clothes, and every feasible point is a
//! global optimum. That is the class an equation-oriented flowsheet
//! initialization hands a solver (IDAES-style: fix the degrees of freedom,
//! solve the square block), and it is the class where an interior-point
//! failure has the least to do with the model: the barrier, the filter and
//! the Hessian approximation all exist to trade objective against
//! feasibility, and here there is no objective to trade.
//!
//! Measured on `square_flowsheet_resto` (32×32, `f ≡ 0`, feasible by
//! construction). Its Jacobian is nearly rank-deficient even at the solution
//! (`σ_min ≈ 3.6e-9` against `σ_max ≈ 3e6`; the near-null direction is a
//! uniform shift of the eight temperatures, pinned only by `exp(-6000/T)`),
//! so the solution set is nearly non-isolated. Under
//! `hessian_approximation=limited-memory` POUNCE on FERAL PR#222 runs to the
//! 3000-iteration cap and every rung of the second-opinion ladder fails too;
//! upstream Ipopt 3.14.19 declares local infeasibility at iteration 50. A
//! Levenberg–Marquardt least-squares solve that uses only `J` solves it from
//! the same start in 8 iterations. The two figures are from two FERALs and
//! both are named: on FERAL PR#222 at default options, `max|c| = 1.9e-10`
//! (recorded when the stage was written); on the published FERAL 0.20 this
//! crate builds against, where rung 4 (`feral_increase_quality=no`) rescues
//! the leg first by default and the stage is reached only with
//! `feral_increase_quality_retry=no`, `max|c| = 2.874e-10` (scaled
//! `1.710e-10`), at `max_iter` 500 and 3000 alike.
//!
//! # The gate
//!
//! [`probe`] opens this stage only when all of the following hold of the TNLP
//! the ladder was handed:
//!
//! * every row is an equality (`g_l == g_u`, finite) and there is at least
//!   one;
//! * the number of **free** variables — `x_l < x_u`, i.e. after removing the
//!   variables `fixed_variable_treatment` would remove — equals the row count;
//! * the objective is constant: the model does not *prove* `∇f` varies
//!   ([`TNLP::derivative_proofs`]), and `∇f` evaluates to exactly zero, every
//!   component, at the starting point.
//!
//! The last test is evaluated, not proved, and that is a deliberate choice.
//! A structural proof would be the stronger gate, but it is not available on
//! the path that matters: presolve wrappers decline `derivative_proofs` (they
//! change what the rows are), and the C, Python and CasADi surfaces hand
//! POUNCE callbacks, not algebra. What makes an evaluated gate safe is that
//! **nothing reported rests on it**. The gate only decides whether to spend
//! the attempt. The verdict rests on the certificate checked at the returned
//! point `x̂` itself (below), which includes `∇f(x̂) = 0` evaluated *there*:
//! at a feasible `x̂` with `∇f(x̂) = 0`, `(λ, z) = (0, 0)` satisfies
//! stationarity and complementarity exactly, so `x̂` is a first-order KKT
//! point by the same definition the IPM's convergence test uses — whether or
//! not `f` is constant anywhere else.
//!
//! # The algorithm
//!
//! A bounded, scaled trust-region Levenberg–Marquardt method on
//! `min ½‖c(x)‖²` over the free variables:
//!
//! * **Step.** Moré's trust-region form (Moré 1978, MINPACK `lmder`/`lmpar`):
//!   with column scaling `D`, the step `p̃ = D p` solves
//!   `(ÃᵀÃ + λI) p̃ = −Ãᵀc`, `Ã = J D⁻¹`, with `λ ≥ 0` chosen so
//!   `‖p̃‖ ≈ Δ` (within 10%) by safeguarded Newton iteration on the secular
//!   equation `1/‖p̃(λ)‖ = 1/Δ`. The Gauss–Newton step is taken when it
//!   already fits.
//! * **Linear algebra.** Each `λ` trial factors the quasi-definite augmented
//!   system `[[λI, Ãᵀ], [Ã, −I]]` with the workspace's sparse symmetric
//!   backend (FERAL) rather than forming `JᵀJ`, which squares the condition
//!   number and densifies. One extra back-solve against the same factor gives
//!   `(ÃᵀÃ + λI)⁻¹ p̃` for the Newton update. At most
//!   [`MAX_LAMBDA_TRIALS`] factorizations per iteration.
//! * **Scaling.** `D_j = max over iterates of ‖J_{:,j}‖₂` (Moré's
//!   non-decreasing column norms), which makes the method invariant to
//!   rescaling a variable — the fixture's variables span `1e-6` to `9e6`.
//!   The rows are **not** reweighted: equilibrating them by `‖J_i(x₀)‖∞` was
//!   measured on the fixture and lost it from every start tried, while the
//!   unweighted merit (MINPACK's, and scipy's `method='lm'`) solves it.
//! * **Bounds.** The trial point is the projection of `x + p` onto the box,
//!   and the gain ratio is computed for the *projected* step against the
//!   linear model, so a projection that destroys the predicted decrease
//!   shrinks `Δ` — which drives `λ` up and the step toward the scaled
//!   (projected) gradient. Every iterate is inside the box by construction.
//!   This is the projected Levenberg–Marquardt idea of Kanzow, Yamashita &
//!   Fukushima (2004), in a trust-region rather than a line-search
//!   globalization.
//! * **Update.** Gain ratio `ρ = ared/pred`; accept when `ρ ≥ 1e-4`; halve
//!   `Δ` (to at most the step taken) when `ρ < 0.25`; set `Δ = 2‖D s‖` when
//!   `ρ > 0.75` or the step was Gauss–Newton. A non-finite residual at the
//!   trial point is a rejection with `Δ` quartered.
//!
//! # Termination and honesty
//!
//! The LM stops as soon as the iterate passes the acceptance test, or fails
//! on an iteration cap (`min(max_iter, 200)`), on a vanishing projected
//! gradient of `‖c‖²` at a non-root ([`STATIONARITY_TOL`]), on `Δ` collapsing to
//! `1e-15·max(‖Dx‖, 1)` (a projected stationary point of `‖c‖²` that is not a
//! root — a *local* least-squares minimum, so the original verdict stands),
//! or on an evaluation / factorization failure.
//!
//! The acceptance test is the IPM's own, at zero multipliers: Ipopt's
//! convergence test asks for the *scaled* overall error below `tol` and the
//! *unscaled* constraint violation below `constr_viol_tol`, and at
//! `(λ, z) = (0, 0)` with `∇f = 0` the dual and complementarity terms vanish,
//! leaving `max_i s_i|c_i| ≤ tol` and `max_i |c_i| ≤ constr_viol_tol`. `s_i`
//! is the row scaling the NLP arm computes for the same model, by the same
//! `pounce_nlp::orig_ipopt_nlp` helpers at the same point (`ipm_scaling`
//! has the details): `none` is `1`; `user-scaling` and `curvature-based`
//! are the TNLP's `g_scaling` floored at `nlp_scaling_min_value`;
//! `gradient-based` — and `equilibration-based`, which the NLP arm runs as
//! gradient-based — is the row-max rule over the full Jacobian sampled at
//! the TNLP's starting point with only fixed variables lifted, applied only
//! when some row exceeds `nlp_scaling_max_gradient` (or a constraint target
//! gradient is set). The one thing not reproduced is a wrapper the
//! application inserts *inside* `optimize_tnlp` that moves the start; that
//! can change `s_i`, but the unscaled half of the test is independent of
//! `s_i`, so no choice of `s_i` admits a point with
//! `max|c_i| > constr_viol_tol`. On top of that
//! the box is satisfied **exactly** (projection; no `bound_relax_factor`
//! widening is borrowed), and `∇f(x̂)` must be exactly zero at the returned
//! point. If any check fails the stage reports failure and the caller keeps
//! the original verdict untouched.
//!
//! # Budget and callback
//!
//! The LM honours `max_wall_time` and `max_cpu_time`, as a budget measured
//! from the start of the stage — the per-solve budget each option rung's
//! `optimize_tnlp` also gets — and reads the clock once per iterate, after
//! the convergence test. It fires the TNLP's `intermediate_callback` at
//! every iterate, the start included, with `mode = RegularMode`, `inf_pr`
//! the scaled violation, `inf_du = max|∇f|`, `mu = 0`, `d_norm` the
//! accepted step's `‖s‖∞` and `regularization_size` the LM parameter; a
//! `false` stops it. A stop or an exhausted budget ends the stage without a
//! promotion. No live iterate is installed for the callback
//! (`GetIpoptCurrentIterate` finds none), because there is no IPM iterate.
//!
//! # What is reported
//!
//! `Solve_Succeeded` with `x̂`, `λ = 0` and `z_l = z_u = 0`, and statistics
//! that describe the LM: `iteration_count` is its iteration count and, when
//! the application records iteration history, `iterations` holds one record
//! per iterate (the start included, the IPM's convention; `alpha_primal_char`
//! `L`); `final_scaled_objective` is `f` times the objective multiplier the
//! NLP arm would have applied. The post-solve computations that read the
//! IPM's converged KKT factor (sIPOPT, the reduced Hessian) have nothing to
//! read and are not run; the CLI says so. Those are true
//! KKT multipliers, not placeholders: with `∇f(x̂) = 0` they satisfy
//! `∇f + Jᵀλ − z_l + z_u = 0` exactly. They are unique when `J(x̂)` is
//! nonsingular and no bound is active; when `J` is singular (as on the
//! fixture, numerically) the multiplier set is a cone containing zero and
//! zero is its minimum-norm member. They are **not** the multipliers an IPM
//! would have reported for the same point, because the IPM never reached it.
//!
//! The root may differ from the one an IPM would have reached: a square
//! system can have several, and the fixture's nearly non-isolated solution
//! set puts the LM root about 11% (relative, in the temperature block) from
//! the generator's `x*`. With a constant objective each is a global optimum.
