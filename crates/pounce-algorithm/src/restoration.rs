//! `RestorationPhase` trait — port of `IpRestoPhase.hpp`.
//!
//! Defined here in `pounce-algorithm` (rather than `pounce-restoration`)
//! so that [`crate::ipopt_alg::IpoptAlgorithm`] can call into it without
//! creating a circular crate dependency. Concrete impls (the default
//! `MinC1NormRestoration`, the rare `RestoRestorationPhase`) live in
//! `pounce-restoration` and `impl RestorationPhase for ...`.
//!
//! Called by the main loop when the line search exhausts its alpha
//! reductions without acceptance (or by the iterate initializer when
//! `start_with_resto = true`). On success the impl writes a recovered
//! iterate to `data.trial` and the main loop accepts it; on failure the
//! main loop surfaces `SolverReturn::RestorationFailure`.
