//! pounce#870 — the `mu_strategy_fallback` floor at the **`finalize_solution`
//! boundary**, which is a different sink from the CLI's report.
//!
//! `honor_original_bounds_finalize.rs` states the split this test depends on:
//! "The CLI reads its `.sol` primal from the `on_converged` hook, but every
//! other consumer — `pounce-py`'s `Problem.solve`, the C interface, any Rust
//! `TNLP` — reads it from `finalize_solution`. Those are two separate lifts of
//! the same iterate." A floor therefore has to cover both, and the two halves
//! of pounce#870's fix cover one each:
//!
//! * restoring `self.statistics` fixes the CLI's report —
//!   `pounce-cli/tests/issue_870_mu_fallback_solution_floor.rs` pins that;
//! * `FinalizeSnapshot::replay` fixes the TNLP payload — this file pins that.
//!
//! **Neither test sees the other's half.** Dropping `replay` leaves the whole
//! CLI suite green while `pounce.minimize` goes back to returning the losing
//! retry's point, which is exactly how the defect stayed invisible: the
//! statistics and the finalize payload are written by different code and only
//! one of them was ever asserted.
//!
//! The trigger here is deterministic rather than a stalled schedule.
//! `Maximum_Iterations_Exceeded` is an unconditional retry trigger, so a low
//! `max_iter` guarantees that attempt 1 caps, the flipped-schedule retry runs
//! and also caps — failing to promote — and the floor must put attempt 1's
//! payload back. No exotic model is needed, and nothing depends on a
//! particular numerical stall surviving future retuning.
//!
//! A losing retry leaks into consumer-visible state through THREE sinks. This
//! file owns two of them; `pounce-cli`'s owns the third.
//!
//! MUTATION TABLE — measured, both directions, against both files:
//!
//! | change                                | this file   | the pounce-cli file |
//! |---------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
//! | drop `floor.replay(&tnlp)`            | 2 of 4 fail | **green**           |
//! | drop the trace re-emit                | 1 of 4 fails| **green**           |
//! | drop the `SolutionCertificate` restore| **green**   | 3 of 5 fail         |
//!
//! The two greens in that table are the point of having two files. Retiring
//! either one leaves half of the fix unprotected, and the surviving file will
//! not tell you so.
