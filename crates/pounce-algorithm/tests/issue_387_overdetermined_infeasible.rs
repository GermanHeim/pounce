//! gh #387 — an over-determined system that is *provably* infeasible must
//! report `InfeasibleProblemDetected`, not `NotEnoughDegreesOfFreedom`.
//!
//! `x == 0.2` with `x == 0.8` over `x in [0, 1]` has an empty feasible set —
//! about as provable as infeasibility gets — yet it exited through the DOF
//! gate (1 variable < 2 equality rows) with the structural 5xx error before
//! anything could look at the constraints. The gate fires before a single
//! iteration runs, so no downstream mechanism ever had the chance to detect
//! the contradiction.
//!
//! The fix consults presolve's bound-propagation certification on the DOF
//! failure path (independent of the `presolve` master switch — nothing is
//! transformed, no solve runs through the probe). The certification's
//! fail-closed safety net is inherited wholesale:
//!
//! * a *consistent* over-determined system still reports the DOF error, and
//! * the witness-refutation rule still withdraws the proof whenever a point in
//!   the declared box genuinely satisfies every row.
//!
//! gh #391 closed the residual: the three smallest row scalings still reported
//! the DOF error, because the witness test's *clamped* accepting form
//! (`tol * max(scale, 1)`) reinstates an absolute floor once a row's magnitude
//! drops below 1, so at `s <= ~3e-8` every point of `[0, 1]` "satisfied" both
//! rows and withdrew a proof whose crossing is `0.6` at every `s`. On this path
//! the solve cannot run, so there is no `Solve_Succeeded` counterfactual for
//! the clamp to protect; the witness now measures against the row's *declared*
//! magnitude with no clamp (`pounce_presolve::WitnessRule`), and the verdict is
//! scale-invariant across the full range.
