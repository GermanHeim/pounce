//! gh #872: the QP second-order verdict must not depend on the units the user
//! chose for their variables.
//!
//! `units_qp_k1.nl` and `units_qp_k1e5.nl` are **the same model** written in two
//! systems of units, `X = K·x` (see `fixtures/units_qp.py`):
//!
//! ```text
//! min  ½(X₀/K)² + ½(X₁/K)² + 5(X₀/K)(X₁/K)     s.t.  −2K ≤ X ≤ 2K
//! ```
//!
//! `H = K⁻²·[[1,5],[5,1]]`, the box scales with `K`, and the minimum is
//! `obj = −16` at `X = (2K, −2K)` for every `K`. Only the units change — metres
//! to micrometres. `|λ_min|/λ_max = 2/3` at both scales, so the Hessian is
//! *strongly* indefinite throughout; nothing here is near roundoff.
//!
//! Before the fix, `K = 1e5` came back:
//!
//! ```text
//! Problem class: convex QP.
//! Number of Iterations....: 0
//! Objective...............:   0.0000000000000000e+00
//! EXIT: Optimal Solution Found.
//! ```
//!
//! Zero iterations, an exactly zero claimed NLP error, and an answer wrong by
//! 100% of the objective. The causal gate was `dispatch::PSD_TOL`, an absolute
//! `1e-9` used both as the classifier's band *and* as the diagonal shift the
//! inertia certificate factors — so at `‖H‖∞ ~ 1e-10` the certificate was
//! reading `1e-9·I` rather than `H`, and was vacuous. Four more absolute floors
//! downstream (`negcurv.rs`'s ladder start, its witness threshold,
//! `active_set.rs`'s `p_scale`, `qp.py`'s `tol_abs`) each independently blocked
//! the rescue once the classifier was fixed, and each is now relative too.
//!
//! **Not covered here:** the NLP arm's own copy of the constant
//! (`NEG_CURV_DELTA_MIN`, `pd_full_space_solver.rs`). Its shift lands on
//! `W + Σ`, not on `H`, so it is not the same one-line change; and on this
//! model the NLP arm agrees with upstream `ipopt`, which also returns `0.0`.
//! That is why the assertions below name `solver_selection=qp-active-set`.
