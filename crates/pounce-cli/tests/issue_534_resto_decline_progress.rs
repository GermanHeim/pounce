//! The acceptable-point restoration decline must not stop a solve that is still
//! converging — and deferring it must never cost the answer (gh #534).
//!
//! THE GUARD. When the line search fails at a point that already passes the
//! acceptable-level tolerances, `IpoptAlgorithm::invoke_restoration` declines to
//! enter restoration and reports that point (upstream
//! `IpBacktrackingLineSearch.cpp`'s `ACCEPTABLE_POINT_REACHED`). The reasoning
//! is sound — restoration reduces the constraint violation, and from an already
//! acceptable point it has nothing to reduce and a reportable solution to lose.
//!
//! WHAT IT WAS MISSING. It read the entry point and nothing about the trajectory
//! that reached it, so it stopped a contracting endgame and a dead stall with
//! equal confidence. On CUTE `eigena2` it fires while the dual infeasibility is
//! quartering every iteration on unit steps (`1.19e-5 → 2.96e-6 → 7.38e-7 →
//! 1.84e-7`), three iterations short of a strict certificate. `#534` adds the
//! missing progress test, plus a floor that makes the resulting bet free.
//!
//! WHAT THIS FILE PINS, and what it does not. `eigena2` is not reproducible
//! here — the benchmark `.nl` archive is gitignored and not in the checkout.
//! `csfi2` is: it is the other model the issue names as reaching this guard, it
//! is small enough to carry as a fixture, and this build reaches the guard on it
//! at `theta 1.501e-7`, matching the value quoted in the issue to four digits.
//! So the two properties tested here are the two that `csfi2` can actually
//! decide:
//!
//!   * a **stall** is still declined, unchanged. `csfi2`'s window at the guard
//!     is `[3.267e0, 1.845e-6, 8.468e-8, 8.524e-8]` — three healthy contractions
//!     and then a flat step — so the progress test refuses and the answer is
//!     bit-identical to `resto_decline_deferrals=0`, the pre-#534 behaviour.
//!   * a **lost bet is free**. Forcing the deferral (`resto_decline_progress_
//!     ratio` large drops the progress requirement) makes `csfi2` take the bet
//!     it should not take: the continuation runs, finds nothing better, the
//!     deadline expires, the floor is restored — and the reported answer is
//!     again bit-identical, at a cost of the ten-iteration budget and no more.
//!
//! That second case is the worst case the issue asks to be guaranteed ("the
//! worst case is the current behaviour plus a few wasted iterations, never a
//! worse reported answer"), exercised on a real model rather than argued.
//!
//! Whether the deferral *converts* an `eigena2`-shaped solve into a strict
//! certificate is NOT tested here, because no model that reaches this guard with
//! a contracting window was reachable from this checkout — every live firing
//! found (the fixture corpus, plus `csfi2` swept over nineteen starting points)
//! is a stall with a flat final step. The progress test's behaviour on the
//! contracting trace is pinned instead as a unit test over the issue's recorded
//! numbers, in `ipopt_alg.rs` (`eigena2_endgame_reads_as_contracting`).
//!
//! FIXTURE PROVENANCE. `fixtures/csfi2.nl` is CUTE `CSFI2` (problem MINLEN in
//! Vasko and Stott, *SIAM Review* 37(1) pp. 82-84, 1995; SIF input A.R. Conn,
//! April 1995), transcribed statement for statement from the AMPL `.mod` in
//! Vanderbei's CUTE-in-AMPL collection and written to `.nl` with Pyomo rather
//! than AMPL. 5 variables, 4 constraints. It is the same problem the benchmark
//! archive carries: this build solves it to `55.017604529660318`, against
//! `55.01760452966031` in `benchmarks/BENCHMARK_REPORT.json`, and reaches the
//! guard at the `theta 1.501e-7` the issue quotes.
