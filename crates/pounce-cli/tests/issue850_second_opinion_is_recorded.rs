//! A promoted second-opinion re-solve must leave a trace (gh #850).
//!
//! # What was invisible
//!
//! When the base solve fails and a ladder rung recovers it, the report's
//! `status` and `statistics.iteration_count` both become the **promoted rung's**
//! and nothing else says the base solver failed. So a fixture that *lost* its
//! baseline solve and is now only rescued by a retry reads in
//! `scripts/sweep-fixtures.sh` as a large improvement:
//!
//! ```text
//!                                          status             iters
//!   v0.10.0, defaults                      SolveSucceeded      116
//!   HEAD, defaults                         SolveSucceeded       54
//!   HEAD, infeasibility_perturbed_start_retry=no   RestorationFailed   131
//! ```
//!
//! `v0.10.0` does not have `infeasibility_perturbed_start_retry` — it rejects
//! the option outright — so that 116 is the *base solver* converging, and
//! HEAD's base solver no longer does. The only thing between the user and a
//! `RestorationFailed` is a rung added in the same release. The sweep read it
//! as `116 -> 54`, **a 2× improvement**.
//!
//! That is worse than a gap in the evidence: `scripts/sweep-fixtures.sh` is the
//! repo's primary trajectory guard and CLAUDE.md makes it the required evidence
//! for a trajectory change, so a guard that converts a lost solve into a
//! recorded win produces positive evidence for the wrong conclusion.
//!
//! Three things had to line up, and they did: the narration is on stdout at the
//! default `print_level`, but `sweep_leg` captures that stdout only to scrape
//! the engine out of it and then deletes it; and the JSON report had no field
//! for any of it. This file pins the JSON half — the sweep column is built from
//! it.
//!
//! # The cost was understated too
//!
//! `statistics.iteration_count` is the promoted rung's **alone**. The 131
//! iterations that failed first are not in it, so that fixture's true cost was
//! `131 + 54 = 185`, 3.4× what the report said.
//!
//! # What recording it made possible
//!
//! With the loss legible it was traced to the `increase_quality` rung, and
//! `feral_increase_quality=no` recovers both of this fixture's legs — see
//! `issue850_increase_quality_regression.rs`, which also records why that is
//! an option rather than a changed default. The column also exposed a second
//! instance the issue never mentions, `degenerate_start_hs008`, whose base
//! solve returns `Infeasible_Problem_Detected` at 9 iterations and which is
//! reported `SolveSucceeded` at `it=5` against a true cost of 30.
