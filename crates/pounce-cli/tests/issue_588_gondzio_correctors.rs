//! gh#588 (Q9) — `qp_gondzio_corr` reaches **both** convex drivers.
//!
//! Q9 moved the Gondzio multiple-centrality-corrector scheme out of the HSDE
//! loop into `pounce_convex::correctors`, gave it a knob, and taught the direct
//! driver (`run_ipm`) to run it too. Three things have to be true, and per
//! gh#551 each has to be shown by driving the real CLI rather than by
//! inspecting a field assignment:
//!
//! 1. **The knob is live on the direct driver** — the one that gained the
//!    scheme. `qp_hsde=no` is that route.
//! 2. **The knob is live on HSDE** — the default route, which has always had
//!    the scheme but never a way to switch it off. If the option did not reach
//!    it, a corrector regression in the field would have no bisection handle.
//! 3. **The default did not move.** The registered default (3) is the value
//!    HSDE hard-coded before this phase, so an unset run must be bit-for-bit
//!    where it was. `scripts/sweep-fixtures.sh` over all 57 fixtures diffed
//!    empty against `d38167a9` at defaults, at `nlp_scaling_method=none` and at
//!    `mu_strategy=adaptive`; the `qp_hsde=no` sweep moved five lines, and the
//!    same sweep with `qp_gondzio_corr=0` diffed empty again — which is what
//!    says those five belong to the correctors and to nothing else.
//!
//! `lp_afiro` is the witness for (1) and (2). It is NETLIB `afiro`, a small
//! degenerate LP of exactly the family Gondzio's paper is about, and it is the
//! only fixture in the corpus whose iteration count moves by more than one.
