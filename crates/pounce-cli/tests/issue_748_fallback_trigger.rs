//! pounce#748 — what the default-on μ-strategy retry is allowed to
//! trigger on.
//!
//! #748 turned `mu_strategy_fallback` on by default, to pay for #746's
//! `dirichlet120` casualty. The retry re-runs a solve under the other
//! `mu_strategy` and keeps the second answer only if it reaches
//! `Solve_Succeeded`. Since #138 it had triggered on two statuses:
//! `Maximum_Iterations_Exceeded` and `Solved_To_Acceptable_Level`.
//!
//! Carrying both into the default broke five test targets, all the same
//! way, and the fixture sweep did not see any of it — the sweep runs
//! default options only, and every one of these needs a non-default
//! option to provoke the downgrade the retry then erased:
//!
//! ```text
//!   optimize_hs71::hs071_kkt_fidelity_tol_downgrades_succeeded
//!   masked_certificate_fuzz::the_earliest_refusal_is_the_one_restored_not_the_strictest
//!   issue_616_ls_init_downgrades::the_safeguards_measured_cost_is_now_csfi2_alone
//!   issue_250_dual_guard_never_worse::dual_guard_diversion_does_not_return_a_worse_point
//!   issue_534_resto_decline_progress::a_lost_deferral_costs_a_bounded_number_of_iterations
//! ```
//!
//! `Solved_To_Acceptable_Level` is not a failure — it is a converged
//! answer at the acceptable tolerance — and retrying it by default is
//! wrong three separate ways:
//!
//! 1. It doubles the cost of a solve that already succeeded. "One extra
//!    solve on a run that had already failed" does not describe this.
//! 2. It launders downgrades the caller induced *deliberately* — a tight
//!    `kkt_fidelity_tol`, a certificate veto, `least_square_init_primal`
//!    — so the signal those options exist to produce never arrives.
//! 3. The retry returns the other run's **point**, not just its status,
//!    so it can hand back a different local solution. On
//!    `autocorr_bern55-06` with the dual-divergence guard enabled it
//!    swapped -2304.0000278 for -2320.0000298.
//!
//! So #748 made the default-on retry trigger on
//! `Maximum_Iterations_Exceeded` alone, and an explicit
//! `mu_strategy_fallback=yes` kept the historical pair. `dirichlet120`
//! stalls at max-iterations, so #748's motivating case is recovered
//! either way.
//!
//! The cost of that narrowing, measured at the time: the three
//! fixture-legs the flip had gained went back to where main had them,
//! and they were the only three that had moved.
//!
//! ```text
//!   exact csfi2           SolveSucceeded 21  -> SolvedToAcceptableLevel 35
//!   lbfgs eigenb2         SolvedToAcceptableLevel 41 -> SolvedToAcceptableLevel 69
//!   lbfgs pooling_rt2stp  SolveSucceeded 295 -> SolvedToAcceptableLevel 362
//! ```
//!
//! # pounce#757 supersedes the status-only half of that rule
//!
//! Narrowing by *status* threw out the stock-configuration recoveries to
//! protect the caller-configured ones. Look again at the five broken
//! targets above: every one of them arms a non-default option to provoke
//! the downgrade the retry erased — `kkt_fidelity_tol`, a certificate
//! veto, `dual_diverging_streak`, `resto_decline_deferrals`. Objections 2
//! and 3 are properties of a caller-MODIFIED configuration, not of the
//! exit status, so the condition that actually separates the cases is not
//! "did we end acceptable" but "did the caller tell us what termination
//! means".
//!
//! #757 makes that the rule. The default-on retry now also takes
//! `Solved_To_Acceptable_Level`, but only while the caller has named none
//! of `Application::TERMINATION_POLICY_OPTIONS`. Objection 1 — cost —
//! survives intact and is the accepted price; what it buys is
//! `cho_parmest`, which stalls 5% short of `tol` on the dual term alone
//! with the iterate frozen, and which adaptive certifies in 20 iterations.
//! The three fixture-legs in the table above come back, and the sweep
//! moves nothing else: 3 of 142 lines, both legs, all improvements.
//!
//! What #748 pinned that still holds is below — the opt-in, the
//! `mu_strategy` condition, and the stand-down, which has simply moved
//! from "any acceptable-level exit" to "an acceptable-level exit the
//! caller's own options may have caused". `issue_757_acceptable_retry`
//! owns the positive half.
