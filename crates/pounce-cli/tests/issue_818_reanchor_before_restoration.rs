//! gh #818 — a line-search failure at an *already feasible* point is not a
//! restoration problem.
//!
//! When the backtracking line search cannot accept any trial step, either
//! the **point** is bad — infeasible, and the restoration phase is exactly
//! the right tool — or the **direction** is, because `W` is a quasi-Newton
//! model carrying curvature the iterate has left behind. Upstream has one
//! answer for both, because restoration is the only fallback it has.
//!
//! At a feasible point that answer is a no-op. The restoration NLP minimizes
//! the constraint violation and there is none to minimize, so it wanders at
//! `theta ~ 1e-13` and reports `Restoration_Failed`. Measured on `deb7` under
//! `limited-memory`: the solve stalls with `inf_pr ~ 1e-12` and `inf_du ~ 1e5`,
//! enters restoration at a point feasible to 8e-13, and spends 340 of its 1242
//! iterations there. On an unconstrained model `theta` is identically zero, so
//! restoration cannot move at all.
//!
//! `IpoptAlgorithm::try_reanchor_before_restoration` puts one rung in front of
//! the hand-off: drop every curvature pair but the newest and retry. It is not
//! a feasibility gate on restoration — that was tried and rejected before (see
//! the `constr_viol_tol` paragraph in `IpoptAlgorithm::invoke_restoration`) —
//! and it runs *after* the acceptable-point decline, so a reportable point is
//! still reported.
//!
//! **The rung ships off.** `limited_memory_ls_failure_restarts` defaults to
//! `0` — upstream's unconditional hand-off. That default was set on a
//! measurement taken at `ALPHA_INTERP_MIN_TRIALS = 5`, where the rung cost
//! iterations on `eigena2` and `infeasible_square_scaled_1em4` to the same
//! verdict and bought only `deb7` and `issue_508_infeasible_gap_1em4`.
//!
//! **At the gate this now ships (6) that ledger has changed**, and the
//! table in `the_rung_ledger_that_decided_the_default` carries the current
//! numbers: `eigena2` gains a reportable point rather than costing
//! iterations. It stays off regardless, because turning it on is a
//! trajectory change over the whole corpus that needs its own
//! `scripts/sweep-fixtures.sh` run, and because `deb7` changes verdict
//! under it. The case for switching it on is open, not settled.
//!
//! Every test here therefore sets the option explicitly on both sides, and
//! both directions are pinned deliberately: the gain is why the code stays
//! in the tree and stays documented, and the cost is why it is not the
//! default. A change that moves either is a change to that decision.
//!
//! **What this file is not evidence about.** It pins that the rung is wired,
//! fires, is switchable, and which way it moves four named models. It does not
//! pin the corpus — that is `scripts/sweep-fixtures.sh` — and it says nothing
//! about the exact-Hessian arm, which has no curvature history to re-anchor.
//! Note also that setting the option at all, `0` included, opts the solve out
//! of the `Solved_To_Acceptable_Level` re-solve ladder
//! (`TERMINATION_POLICY_OPTIONS`), so every cell below runs in a regime the
//! shipped default never enters.
