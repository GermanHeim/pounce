//! The inertia test must not be run against a factorization that cannot
//! answer it (gh #540).
//!
//! WHAT WENT WRONG. CUTE `eigena2` stopped at `Solved To Acceptable Level`
//! with the dual infeasibility stuck at 3.3e-7, where Ipopt certifies
//! `Optimal` at 5.2e-9. The objective was already right to twelve digits;
//! only the last two orders of the dual residual were missing. The reported
//! symptom was that `δ_w` re-escalated from `10^-0.8` to `10^1.4` at the
//! second-to-last iteration and damped the Newton step from `1.2e-7` to
//! `8.2e-9`, which is where the superlinear tail went.
//!
//! WHY. Not the `δ_w` update rule — that is an exact port of upstream's
//! `get_deltas_for_wrong_inertia` and it did what it is told. The input was
//! wrong. `eigena2`'s constraint Jacobian degenerates as the iterate
//! converges (45 of its 55 singular values fall to ~1e-8 by iteration 27, on
//! a `‖A‖ ≈ 240` KKT), so every factorization taken with `δ_c = 0` down that
//! tail is singular to working precision, with a smallest pivot at ~1e-16.
//! The negative-eigenvalue count read off such a factor is noise: the same
//! iterate returned 64, 58 and 62 against an expected 55, and a LAPACK
//! eigendecomposition of the dumped matrices agrees with none of those. The
//! `δ_w` ladder then escalated ×8 per retry against a reading that does not
//! respond to `δ_w` at all. The perturbation that *does* repair a
//! rank-deficient constraint block is `δ_c` — and `δ_c` is exactly what the
//! `Singular` verdict reaches for. The fix routes there:
//! `feral_inertia_pivot_floor` reports `Singular` instead of `WrongInertia`
//! when the count is contradicted by a working-precision pivot. Applying
//! `δ_c` lifts the smallest pivot from ~1e-16 to 5.8e-9, and from that point
//! the counts feral reports agree with LAPACK exactly.
//!
//! The trigger only ever fires on a factorization the caller was already
//! going to reject, so it cannot turn a usable factor into a failure; that
//! property is pinned as a unit test in `pounce-feral`
//! (`well_conditioned_inertia_mismatch_still_reports_wrong_inertia`).
//!
//! FIXTURE PROVENANCE. `fixtures/eigena2.nl` is CUTE `EIGENA2` (the
//! symmetric eigenvalue problem posed as an equality-constrained NLP; 110
//! variables, 55 equality constraints) from Vanderbei's CUTE-in-AMPL
//! collection, the same `.nl` the reporter ran, attached to gh #540 because
//! the benchmark archive itself is gitignored and not in the checkout. On
//! this build the pre-fix behaviour reproduces the issue's numbers exactly:
//! 29 iterations, dual infeasibility 3.3144912958031115e-07, constraint
//! violation 2.4123147923660326e-11, `Solved To Acceptable Level`.

/// It used to assert that disabling the trigger *reproduced the reported

/// gh#693: with the least-squares multiplier perturbation removed from the
/// initializer, `y0` changes, the trajectory changes, and the pre-#540
/// route converges on this model instead of stalling. `eigena2` is fixed by

/// The old guard existed precisely to fail in this situation rather than go
/// quiet, and it did — it is being replaced deliberately, not silenced.
/// What is lost is real: **no fixture in this repo now reproduces the gh#540
/// failure**, so the trigger's necessity is pinned by nothing. See gh#693.
///
/// What is still true, and is what this asserts: on the default path the
/// trigger measurably improves the certificate. With it on, `eigena2`
/// converges in 27 iterations at dual 3.43e-10; with
/// `feral_inertia_pivot_floor=0` it takes 29 and lands at 5.45e-09 — 16x
/// worse, deterministic across runs.
///
/// **Two caveats a reader has to have, or this test reads stronger than it
/// is.** First, the margin is narrow to the default path: under
/// `POUNCE_DBG_NO_QUAD=1` the two configurations land at 5.21e-09 and
/// 5.27e-09, indistinguishable. Second, the *ordering* is newly true. On
/// 0.10.0 the trigger made this model's dual residual slightly **worse** —
/// 2.21e-09 with it on against 5.95e-10 with it off, both clearing `tol`:
///
/// ```text
///                          trigger ON        trigger OFF
///   main (0.10.0)          2.212e-09         5.947e-10     <- trigger hurts
///   with gh#693            3.432e-10         5.447e-09     <- trigger helps
/// ```
///
/// So the trigger had already stopped being load-bearing on `eigena2` at the
/// default before gh#693 touched anything; what gh#693 removed was the last
/// configuration (`POUNCE_DBG_NO_QUAD=1`, trigger off) under which the
/// original failure still appeared. This assertion pins a real, reproducible
/// effect of the current build — not a stable invariant of the fix. The
/// property gh#540 actually established, that a count read off a
/// working-precision pivot routes to `delta_c` instead of the `delta_w`
/// ladder, is pinned where it belongs: the `pounce-feral` unit test named in
