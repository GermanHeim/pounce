//! gh #767: the convex path must present the same end-of-run contract as the
//! NLP path — timing statistics when asked for them, an `EXIT:` banner and a
//! machine-readable `Status:` line, and a JSON `solution` a consumer can
//! compare against Ipopt's own enumerator spelling.
//!
//! All three gaps were found while instrumenting the Mittelmann suite, where
//! two of 47 instances route convex and the other 45 do not:
//!
//! 1. `print_timing_statistics=yes` was accepted, reported `(used)` by
//!    `print_user_options`, and emitted nothing. A tool attributing solve cost
//!    by phase then read 0% for *every* phase of a convex-routed instance,
//!    which reads as "already fast" rather than "not measured" — `bearing_400`
//!    ran 9.8 s and printed no timer at all.
//! 2. The log ended after the residual block: no `EXIT:`, no `Status:`. Every
//!    consumer of the CLI other than `benchmarks/scripts/run_nl_bench.sh` — which
//!    carries its own ladder of convex-specific stdout scrapes — had to
//!    reimplement that ladder.
//! 3. The JSON report's `solution.status` is the Rust variant name
//!    (`SolveSucceeded`) on *both* paths, while the spelling every Ipopt-facing
//!    consumer keys off is `Solve_Succeeded`. A consumer comparing against the
//!    latter matched nothing and silently classified every solve as a failure,
//!    and only noticed on the convex path because that path printed no
//!    `Status:` line to compare with. The report now carries both spellings.
//!
//! The tests run every convex arm the router can reach — the QP/LP
//! interior-point engine, the parametric active-set engine, and the conic
//! (QCQP) engine — because each has its own driver and its own linear algebra,
//! and a green leg on one says nothing about the others.
