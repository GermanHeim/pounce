//! gh#819 — the iteration count a restoration-terminating solve reports.
//!
//! Ipopt's summary line `Number of Iterations....:` is the **index of the
//! last printed iteration row**, `r` rows included, on every exit path.
//! Measured, not assumed, over four upstream logs from this repo's issue
//! corpus: `2418r`/2418 (Restoration Failed), `412r`/412 (local
//! infeasibility), `1547r`/1547 and `1348r`/1348.
//!
//! POUNCE printed the same `r` rows and then reported a number that ignored
//! them. Three separate defects stacked up:
//!
//! 1. The outer `iter_count` roll-forward lived only on the `Recovered` path
//!    (`min_c_1nrm.rs` step 2g). All four *terminating* restoration outcomes
//!    return ahead of it, so a solve that ended inside restoration reported
//!    the outer count at the moment restoration was entered — the whole
//!    sub-solve simply vanished from the summary.
//! 2. `restoration_inner_iters` summed the inner IPM's **absolute**
//!    terminating `iter_count`. That counter is seeded from the outer's
//!    (`inner.iter_count = outer_iter + 1`, mirroring `IpRestoMinC_1Nrm.cpp`
//!    line 181), so the sum was a position in the shared `r`-row numbering,
//!    not a length. gh#664 documents the same misreading for the stall gate.
//! 3. The count was read off the `Some(result)` arm, so on every path that
//!    bailed — which is every path that *ends* in restoration — it recorded
//!    `0`.
//!
//! # What this file pins
//!
//! Both halves of the fix, on the failing path, against a real solve:
//! the reported total equals the last row's index, and the new restoration
//! line equals the number of `r` rows actually printed. Both are parsed out
//! of the log rather than hardcoded, so the assertions survive a trajectory
//! change that moves the numbers without breaking the identity.
//!
//! # What it is *not* evidence about
//!
//! One fixture, one exit path (`Restoration_Failed`), one linear solver. The
//! `Recovered` path had a working roll-forward before this change and still
//! does; `restoration_deadline.rs` is what covers the multi-call arm. The
//! `Infeasible_Problem_Detected` and `MaximumIterationsExceeded` restoration
//! exits are not reached here.
