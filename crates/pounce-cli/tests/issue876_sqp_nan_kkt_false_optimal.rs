//! gh #876 — a `NaN` iterate on the active-set SQP arm is not an optimal
//! solution.
//!
//! `unbounded_cubic.nl` under `algorithm=active-set-sqp
//! hessian_approximation=limited-memory` printed, in this order:
//!
//! ```text
//! Objective...............:   nan    nan
//! Overall NLP error.......:   0.0000000000000000e+00    0.0000000000000000e+00
//! EXIT: Optimal Solution Found.
//! Status: Solve_Succeeded
//! ```
//!
//! A perfect zero KKT error beside a `nan` objective, and success reported on
//! the strength of the zero. The mechanism is `f64::max`'s definition: it
//! *ignores* `NaN`, so `fold(0.0, f64::max)` over an all-`NaN` vector is
//! `0.0`, and `0.0 <= tol` passes. `check_kkt` reduced **both** of its
//! residuals that way — the stationarity rows through the fold the issue
//! names, and the constraint violation one layer earlier through
//! `(bl - c).max(0.0)`, which turns a `NaN` row into a tidy "perfectly
//! feasible" `0.0` before the outer `max` ever sees it. Fixing only the
//! reported site would have left `constr_viol` lying.
//!
//! This is the third instance of the shape in this workspace: gh #222 in
//! `pounce-convex` (which has carried a short-circuiting `inf_norm` ever
//! since), gh #845 in `pounce-sensitivity`, and now the SQP arm.
//!
//! The residual-level assertions live next to the code, in
//! `pounce-algorithm`'s `sqp::sqp_alg::kkt_nan_tests`, with the mutation
//! table showing that neither half of the fix subsumes the other. What is
//! only reachable from *here* is the plumbing: that an honest `NaN` residual
//! actually reaches the user as a failure verdict rather than falling into
//! some other gate that rounds it back to success.
//!
//! ## What this file is NOT evidence about
//!
//! * **`Invalid_Number_Detected` is not the same claim as
//!   `Diverging_Iterates`.** `unbounded_cubic.nl` is unbounded, and the
//!   *exact* leg says so — its step QP certifies a recession ray and the arm
//!   returns `SqpStatus::Unbounded` (gh #388). The limited-memory leg cannot:
//!   an L-BFGS matrix is positive definite by construction, so its step QP is
//!   never unbounded, the ray is never certified, and the iterates run off
//!   numerically instead. `Invalid_Number_Detected` is the honest report of
//!   what happened on that leg — "the arithmetic went non-finite and we
//!   stopped" — not a claim about boundedness. Giving the SQP arm its own
//!   `diverging_iterates_tol` guard, so both legs reach the *same* verdict on
//!   this model, is a trajectory change and is deliberately not attempted
//!   here.
//! * **Only the SQP arm.** The interior-point arm has screened this since it
//!   was written (`ipopt_alg.rs`, `if !nlp_err.is_finite()`), and this fix is
//!   modelled on it precisely so the two arms cannot disagree about what a
//!   `NaN` iterate means.
//! * **Not a sweep result.** The default-arm and SQP-arm fixture sweeps run
//!   for this change are a no-collateral-damage check; see the PR. What they
//!   did turn up is worth recording here, because no test in this file
//!   asserts it: the default arm is unmoved on all 180 fixture-legs, and the
//!   SQP arm moves exactly **two**, both on the limited-memory leg and both
//!   on unbounded models. `unbounded_cubic` is the reported defect
//!   (`SolveSucceeded` it=9 → `InvalidNumberDetected` it=8). `unbounded_exp`
//!   is a *second* manifestation the issue does not mention:
//!   `MaximumIterationsExceeded` it=200 → `InvalidNumberDetected` it=3. It
//!   was never falsely optimal, because its iterates went to `±inf` rather
//!   than `NaN` and `inf.abs()` survives a `max`-fold intact — so it failed
//!   the tolerance honestly and then ground out 197 further iterations on an
//!   iterate that had stopped meaning anything. Same defect, other flavour of
//!   non-finite, and the reason the screen tests `is_finite()` rather than
//!   `is_nan()`.
