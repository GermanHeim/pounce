//! What the second-opinion ladder and the degeneracy banners actually *do*,
//! end to end, through the CLI.
//!
//! `pounce-algorithm/tests/init_options_wiring.rs` proves the three `*_retry`
//! tags are read; `second_opinion.rs` and `second_opinion_driver.rs` pin the
//! rung table and the driver loop against hand-built option lists. None of
//! that runs a solve. This file is the missing half: a real model, a real
//! degenerate start, and the ladder either recovering it or not.
//!
//! Both fixtures are HS008 (`x² + y² = 25`, `x·y = 9`) started at the origin,
//! where **both** Jacobian rows are identically zero — LICQ fails and the
//! filter line search has no descent direction to find. That is the failure
//! mode `start_point_perturbation` exists for, and the one the KRONOS corpus
//! is full of (a squared slack at zero, an origin start on a homogeneous
//! quadratic). The second fixture flips the first constraint to
//! `x² + y² = -25`, which no real point satisfies, so the model is *both*
//! degenerate at its start and genuinely infeasible — the case where the
//! ladder must spend all three rungs and still keep its verdict.
