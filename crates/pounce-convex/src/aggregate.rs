//! **Doubleton-equality aggregation** for the convex presolve (gh #494).
//!
//! [`crate::presolve`]'s catalog could fix a variable from a *singleton*
//! equality row and substitute out a *free column singleton*, but had no
//! reduction for the row that carries a flowsheet: `a₁·x + a₂·y = b`
//! linking two otherwise-free interior variables, with no anchoring
//! requirement on either. That is the arc equality, the `Reference` alias,
//! the unit-conversion link. This module adds it.
//!
//! # Sharing the planner, not the wrapper
//!
//! The *which variables can go* half is not restated here.
//! [`pounce_presolve::linear_eq_plan`] already decides it for the general
//! NLP path (Phase 6, gh #487), and its [`PlanInput`] is pure data —
//! per-row `(col, coeff)` lists, right-hand sides, an eligibility mask and
//! a box. No TNLP appears in it. So the convex path feeds its `QpProblem`
//! equality rows straight in and inherits, for free:
//!
//! - the fixed-point iteration over the three shapes (equal bounds,
//!   singleton row, two-variable row), so alias *chains* collapse;
//! - the union-by-size pivot tie-break that keeps those chains shallow;
//! - the fail-closed posture — a contradictory system, or one that removes
//!   every column, returns the identity plan and this pass does nothing.
//!
//! What is written here is the convex half: applying `x = M·y + d` to
//! `P`, `c`, `A`, `G`, and the postsolve in `(y, z)` conventions.
//!
//! # Convexity survives
//!
//! The substitution is a congruence, `P' = Mᵀ P M`, so `P ⪰ 0 ⇒ P' ⪰ 0`.
//! The reduced problem is convex whenever the original was, and the LP/QP
//! classification made upstream stays true of what the solver receives.
//! (Pinned by `presolve_aggregation.rs`, not assumed.)
//!
//! # The dual, and where a bound multiplier lands
//!
//! Row multipliers come from [`recover_dropped_multipliers`] — the same
//! reverse triangular sweep the NLP path uses, in the same `∇f + Jᵀλ − z_l
//! + z_u = 0` convention `crate::presolve` already works in. Only the row
//! block differs: the plan consumes *equality* rows, so `Gᵀz` is folded
//! into the gradient the sweep is handed rather than resolved by it.
//!
//! Bound multipliers need one step the NLP path skips. Planning transfers
//! an eliminated variable's box onto its survivor, so a reduced solve
//! reports the *survivor* carrying a bound force that, in the original
//! problem, belongs to the eliminated variable — and may name a bound the
//! survivor does not even have (gh #493 documents this attribution for the
//! NLP path, where full-space stationarity still holds because the
//! survivor's own bound multiplier absorbs it). That is not available
//! here: [`crate::presolve`]'s contract is a valid KKT point of the
//! *original* problem, and a multiplier on a bound the original does not
//! declare is not one. So the leftover reduced cost at each survivor is
//! re-attributed to whichever cluster member is actually sitting on its
//! own declared bound, and the sweep is re-run with that force in place.
//! See [`postsolve`].
//!
//! That step is for **library callers**, and it is worth saying which,
//! because the answer is not the obvious one. The CLI's `.nl` extractor
//! lowers every variable bound to a row of `G`, so a model arriving that
//! way reaches this pass with an *empty box* — nothing to transfer, and
//! each bound's force lands on an ordinary inequality multiplier the sweep
//! already accounts for. A box gets here only from a caller who builds a
//! `QpProblem` with `lb`/`ub` directly (`pounce-py`, the batch API, an
//! embedder), or from [`crate::presolve`]'s own bound tightening. The
//! adversary run for gh #494 measured this rather than guessing at it: 0
//! of 114 `.nl` instances reached the re-attribution, against 19 of 400
//! library-level draws in `tests/presolve_aggregation.rs`.
