"""The second-opinion ladder, from Python.

The ladder used to live in `crates/pounce-cli/src/main.rs`, so a caller
embedding POUNCE did not get it — which was backwards. A caller reaching the
solver from a modelling layer is the one most likely to hand over an
uninitialized starting point, an uninitialized decision variable arrives as a
zero, and the origin is exactly where a squared slack or a homogeneous
quadratic loses rank. These tests pin the things that move when the
ladder becomes a library feature.

    a property of the platform's arithmetic and not of the model: gh#857's
