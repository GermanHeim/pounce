"""Phase-changing flash as an MPCC: the Gate 1 model, and its oracle.

A single equilibrium stage whose temperature path crosses single-liquid,
two-phase and single-vapor, formulated as a mathematical program with
complementarity constraints and checked against an independent flash.
This is the model behind notebook 38 and behind the evidence harness in
`benchmarks/flash/`; it deliberately stops short of being a property
package, exactly as `phase_envelope` does.

Why a flash is an MPCC at all
-----------------------------

Phase appearance is awkward in an equation-oriented model. A formulation
that only instantiates equations for the phases that are present changes
dimension at a switching event; explicit on/off variables make it a
mixed-integer problem; smoothing or clipping converges to false phase
states. Complementarity says "the phase amount is zero **or** its
stability condition is active" while keeping the dimension fixed.

That convenience has a mathematical price: an MPCC violates the standard
constraint qualifications at every feasible point, so ordinary NLP
convergence theory cannot be quoted about it without care. This module
is the smallest honest instance of the trade.

The model
---------

For ``nc`` components at fixed ``(T, P)`` with feed ``z``, the unknowns
are the vapor fraction ``beta`` and the two phases' mole numbers per
unit feed, ``x`` (liquid) and ``y`` (vapor)::

    n = 2 nc + 1        variables   [beta, x_1..x_nc, y_1..y_nc]

    z_i = (1 - beta) x_i + beta y_i                           (balance)
    ln x_i + ln phi_i^L(x/Sx)
        = ln y_i + ln phi_i^V(y/Sy)                       (isofugacity)

    0 <= beta      _|_  1 - Sy >= 0                            (pair V)
    0 <= 1 - beta  _|_  1 - Sx >= 0                            (pair L)

with ``Sx = sum_i x_i`` and ``Sy = sum_i y_i``.

Why *these* pairs, and not ``L _|_ V``
--------------------------------------

The pair is "nonnegative phase amount complementary to nonnegative
stability slack", and **not** liquid flow complementary to vapor flow:
the two phases coexist on a two-phase tray, so ``L _|_ V`` would encode
the wrong physics. What is written above is that rule with the slack
identified:

* ``beta`` is the vapor amount and ``1 - Sy`` is the vapor's stability
  slack. Where no vapor is present the vapor variables are not junk --
  they are Michelsen's *trial phase*. Setting ``beta = 0`` makes the
  balance give ``x = z``, hence ``Sx = 1``, and the isofugacity rows
  collapse to ``ln y_i + ln phi_i(y/Sy) = ln z_i + ln phi_i(z)``, which
  is exactly the stationarity condition of the tangent-plane distance.
  ``Sy <= 1`` is then exactly ``TPD >= 0``. The complementarity is not
  an encoding trick: it *is* the stability test.
* ``1 - beta`` is the liquid amount and ``1 - Sx`` its slack, by the
  mirror argument at ``beta = 1``.
* In the two-phase regime both amounts are positive, so both slacks
  vanish, ``Sx = Sy = 1``, and the rows are the ordinary isofugacity
  conditions.

At the bubble point ``beta = 0`` **and** ``Sy = 1`` together: pair V is
biactive. At the dew point pair L is. The two regime switches are
therefore exactly the two biactive points of this MPCC, which is what
makes it a phase-change test rather than a decorated NLP -- the
degeneracy is the physics, not an artifact of writing it this way.

Where the normalization goes
----------------------------

``phi_i`` is a function of a *composition*, so it is evaluated at
``x/Sx`` and ``y/Sy``. The logarithm outside it is **not** normalized:
the row is ``ln x_i + ln phi_i(x/Sx)``, not ``ln(x_i/Sx) + ln
phi_i(x/Sx)``. That asymmetry is Michelsen's tangent plane, not a typo,
and normalizing the log term as well adds ``ln(Sy/Sx)`` to every row.

It is worth stating at length because the first implementation of this
model got it wrong in exactly that way, and the shape of the error is
the shape the cross-check exists to catch: ``ln(Sy/Sx)`` **vanishes
identically in the two-phase region**, where ``Sx = Sy = 1``, so the
model solved, converged, and agreed with the oracle at every two-phase
temperature. It was wrong only in the single-phase regimes -- the ones
the fixture exists to reach.

Layout
------

``ln_phi`` ... ``supercritical_components``
    the Peng--Robinson layer over `phase_envelope`, and the
    cubic-root / trivial-solution / supercritical guards.
`FlashCase`, `PAIRS`, `GATE1_FLASH`
    the source model, its complementarity pairs and what each branch
    means, and the pinned case.
`tangent_plane`, `flash`, `bubble_and_dew`
    the independent oracle: Michelsen stability with a multistart per
    phase label, Rachford--Rice with a Newton polish, and the
    switch-point bisection.
`lower`, `LoweredFlash`, `fd_check`
    MPCC -> smooth NLP with exact JAX derivatives.

All temperatures are in K, pressures in Pa, and phase amounts are moles
per mole of feed unless a docstring says otherwise.

# The last row is an asymmetry and it is the right way round. The
# MPCC's single-phase branch asserts that the *one* trial phase its
# solve landed on has `sum Y <= 1`; Michelsen's test is a statement
# about the global minimum of the tangent-plane distance, which no
# single stationary point establishes. Agreement therefore means the
# MPCC found the stationary point that matters, and a disagreement is a
# finding about the MPCC rather than about the oracle.
#
# Why the cubic root is chosen by phase label
# -------------------------------------------
#
# The first draft chose each root by comparing reduced Gibbs energies,
# on the reasoning that an energy criterion is more principled than a
# label. Measured, it is wrong here in two ways a green two-phase
# region would have hidden:
#
# * It collapses the trial phase onto the trivial solution wherever the
#   feed's cubic has one real root. At 230 K and 350 K on the pinned
#   path the feed has a single root, so "the other root" does not exist
#   to compare against, and every start converged to `Y = z`. The
#   oracle reported "stable, no incipient phase", which reads as a
#   well-posed answer and is not one: iterating with the *opposite
#   label* to the feed finds the incipient phase at `sum Y = 0.394`
#   (230 K) and `0.622` (350 K).
# * It makes the two-phase system symmetric. With both phases at
#   whichever root is lower in Gibbs energy, `(x, y, beta)` and
#   `(y, x, 1-beta)` are both solutions, and at 310 K the Newton polish
#   returned the mirror one -- `beta = 0.339` where the answer is
#   `0.661`. Labelling the roots breaks the symmetry, because the
#   liquid *is* the small root and the vapor the large one.
#
# So both calculations use the label convention. That costs a dimension
# of independence, and the honest replacement is to check the
# convention rather than to vary it: `root_diagnostics` compares the
# label-selected root against the lower-Gibbs one wherever two roots
# exist. The guard is that check, not the choice.

#: Successive substitution stops here; the Newton polish takes it the
#: rest of the way. SS alone converges linearly with a ratio that
#: approaches one near a switch point, and an oracle only as tight as
#: the thing it judges is not an oracle.

# MPCC -> smooth NLP
# ====================================================================
#
# The three lowerings are the ones gh#794 compared, unchanged, because
# comparing this model against Gate 0's supported route only means
# something if the route is the same object:
#
#   prod_ineq   H >= 0, G*H <= 0. The direct formulation; its feasible
#               points are exactly the MPCC's, since G, H >= 0 makes
#               G*H <= 0 equivalent to G*H = 0.
#   prod_eq     the same with G*H = 0: exact-product / NCP equality.
#   scholtes    G*H <= tau, feasible for the MPCC only as tau -> 0.
#
# Two things differ from Gate 0's algebraic corpus, and both are
# properties of the model rather than choices:
#
# * **The `G` sides are bounds, not rows.** `G_V = beta` and
#   `G_L = 1 - beta` are already enforced exactly by `beta in [0, 1]`,
#   and adding them again as rows would put two linearly dependent rows
#   into every active set for no gain. An MPCC's active set is
#   degenerate enough by construction; manufacturing more of it makes a
#   solver failure harder to attribute.
# * **The rows are nonlinear.** Gate 0's corpus is quadratic with
#   affine pairs so that every derivative is closed-form. Here the
#   isofugacity rows carry a cubic root and a logarithm, so the
#   derivatives come from JAX -- exact to round-off, not finite
#   differences -- and `fd_check` verifies them against a central
#   difference anyway, because "the derivative is the first suspect"
#   survives the change of technique.
#
# Row order is fixed and is part of the contract; a caller reads
# multipliers back out of `info["mult_g"]` positionally:
#
#     [ balance_1..nc ] [ isofug_1..nc ] [ H_V ] [ H_L ] [ prod_V ] [ prod_L ]

#: converged answers were right: the full traversal agreed with the
#: oracle to 1e-11 at all 34 temperatures *with the wrong Hessian*. It
#: costs iterations and robustness at the one place the fixture exists
#: to test, and nothing reports it.
#:
#: Unjitting the Hessian also fixes it and costs 240 ms per call against
#: 0.15 ms, which is not available to a fixture gh#776 asks to be fast.
#: Forward-over-forward is exact and free.
#:
#: ``temperature_k`` is a *traced* argument, not baked in, so the whole
#: temperature path shares one compilation. Closing over it instead --
#: which the first draft did, via `functools.partial` -- costs a JAX
#: compilation per stage: 34 temperatures times ten continuation stages
#: is 340 of them, and the traversal spent essentially all of its wall
#: clock compiling the same function again. Compilation time is not
#: measurement, and a fixture gh#776 asks to be *fast* cannot pay it per
#: stage.
