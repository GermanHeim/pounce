# Single- or dual-solver .nl benchmark driver.
#
# Solves every *.nl under a suite directory (the AMPL solver protocol)
# with pounce, ipopt-ma57, or both, and writes a results JSON array in
# the standard schema:
#
#   [{"solver":"pounce|ipopt", "name":..., "n":..., "m":...,
#     "status":..., "objective":..., "iterations":..., "solve_time":...}, ...]
#
# Usage:
#   run_nl_bench.sh <suite_name> <nl_dir> <results_json> \
#                   <pounce_bin> <ipopt_bin> <time_limit_seconds> [mode]
#
# mode (default "both"):
#   pounce  — run only pounce         (ipopt_bin may be "-"/unused)
#   ipopt   — run only ipopt-ma57     (pounce_bin may be "-"/unused)
#   both    — run both (legacy behaviour)
#
# The pounce-vs-ipopt split lets the expensive ipopt reference be run
# once and saved (mode=ipopt → benchmarks/<suite>/ipopt_ma57.json) while
# each release reruns only pounce (mode=pounce → <suite>/pounce.json).
# Output feeds benchmark_report.py, which merges the two per suite.

# The fallbacks are ordered by how much they can be trusted, and that order is

# ranks phrases rather than reading the run: one pounce invocation can print
# several `EXIT:` banners — the local-infeasibility second-opinion ladder
# prints one per rung (gh #524), and the engine prints one per solve — and a
# ranked scrape returns whichever phrase it happens to rank first, which need
# not be the verdict that shipped. Measured: on `cresc100` the barrier rung
# exits at `max_iter` and the original infeasibility verdict then stands, but
# "Maximum Number of Iterations Exceeded" outranks "Converged to a point of
# local infeasibility", so the scrape recorded `Maximum_Iterations_Exceeded`
# for a run whose verdict was `Infeasible_Problem_Detected`. Reading the LAST
# banner instead is correct by construction: pounce re-emits the verdict that
# actually shipped as its final banner (gh #508).
