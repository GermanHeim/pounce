"""User NLP scaling from Pyomo's `scaling_factor` Suffix (gh #483).

The Pyomo/Ipopt workflow for hand-supplied scaling is::

    model.scaling_factor = Suffix(direction=Suffix.EXPORT)
    model.scaling_factor[model.obj] = 1e-3
    model.scaling_factor[model.mass_balance] = 1e2
    solver.options['nlp_scaling_method'] = 'user-scaling'

Through ASL the writer emits those entries as `.nl` `S4`/`S5`/`S6`
suffix segments and the solver reads them back. pyomo-pounce contained
no scaling code at all, so the option was accepted and meant "none": a
badly conditioned model kept converging badly with nothing to say the
suffix had been ignored.

Three things happen here now:

* **Objective and constraint factors are honored.** The subprocess
  (ASL) path needs nothing from this module — the writer emits the
  suffix segments and `NlTnlp::get_scaling_parameters` now reads them.
  The in-process sensitivity path builds no `.nl` for the solver, so
  :func:`problem_scaling` translates the Suffix into the vectors
  `pounce.Problem.set_problem_scaling` wants.
* **Variable factors reach the solver** (gh #486 stage 2). The core
  applies them as a change of variables one level below the algorithm
  and returns the solution in the model's own units, so no clone and
  no ``propagate_solution`` step is involved.
* **The sensitivity path honors them too** (gh #486 stage 3).
  :func:`problem_scaling` translates the variable entries alongside the
  row ones, and the sensitivity accessors carry the factors through
  their natural-units translation, so a variable-scaled solve answers
  every query in the model's own units. Stages 1 and 2 refused those
  queries rather than answering them in scaled coordinates; nothing is
  refused now.

Semantics, matching the AMPL/Ipopt reading of the suffix:

* Only an **export-enabled** Suffix named ``scaling_factor`` counts.
* Components the Suffix does not list are unscaled (factor 1.0), as are
  components listed with a factor of 0 — AMPL's suffix default is 0 and
  0 is not a usable scale.
* Entries on **inactive** constraints/objectives and on **fixed**
  variables are skipped: none of them is a row or column of the problem
  the solver is handed.
* An entry on a container (``scaling_factor[m.mass_balance]`` for an
  IndexedConstraint) applies to every member, which is how the NL
  writer expands it.

    maps an original constraint's name to the clone name the
    declared-parameter surgery gave it, exactly as in
